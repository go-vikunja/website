# Security

Vikunja recognizes the importance of excellent security practices. While we are a small team focused on providing 
efficient task and project organization, we work hard to ensure top-notch security for all our users.
We understand that project management often involves sensitive information, and we are
committed to protecting your data with the utmost care.

This document covers our security practices and policies. If you are interested in the data we collect and store, please
refer to our [privacy policy](/privacy). 

## General practices

* Access to production servers, source code repositories, and integrated third-party services are secured with two-factor authentication.
* We implement strong, randomly-generated passwords that are unique to each system and user.
* Vikunja team members and contractors are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their duties. This typically excludes direct access to production systems or user data.
* We employ automated security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in our codebase and dependencies. We prioritize rapid application of security patches and swift deployment of updates.
* We donâ€™t copy production data to external devices (like personal laptops).

## Vikunja Cloud Hosting

All parts of Vikunja Cloud are hosted at [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) in Germany and Finland.
Their data centers are kept secure through multiple layers of [physical, network and system security](https://www.hetzner.com/assets/Uploads/downloads/Sicherheit-en.pdf)
and their [ISO/IEC 27001 certification](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/zertifizierung).

At Vikunja, we consider the security of the product and our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put
into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a vulnerability either in the product itself or Vikunja Cloud, we would like to know about it so we can
take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our
systems.

### Out of scope vulnerabilities:

- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
- Unauthenticated/logout/login CSRF.
- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
- Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS.
- Email spoofing
- Missing DNSSEC, CAA, CSP headers
- Lack of Secure or HTTP only flag on non-sensitive cookies
- Deadlinks

### Please do the following:

- E-mail your findings to security@vikunja.io.
- Do not run automated scanners on our infrastructure or dashboard. If you wish to do this, contact us and we will set
  up a sandbox for you.
- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than
  necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people's data,
- Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved,
- Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of
  third parties,
- Do not ask for money without presenting any evidence about your claims. We will consider compensation based on the
  impact of your findings.
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible.
  Usually, the IP address or the URL of the affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient,
  but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

### What we promise:

- We will respond to your report quickly with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date,
- If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report,
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without
  your permission,
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem,
- In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (
  unless you desire otherwise), and
- We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and we would like to play an active role in the ultimate
  publication on the problem after it is resolved.
