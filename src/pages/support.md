# Support Vikunja

Vikunja is an open-source project built with care and dedication. There are many ways you can support the project and help
it grow, whether through financial contributions, using our hosted services, or working with us directly.

## Sponsor the Project

Your financial support helps us maintain and improve Vikunja. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference
and allows us to dedicate more time to developing new features and fixing bugs.

* **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kolaente):** Sponsor us directly through GitHub to support ongoing development.
* **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vikunja):** For transparent, community-based funding. Especially great for organizations that need receipts or want to see how funds are used.
* **[Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kolaente):** Support the development with a one-time or recurring contribution.

## Use Vikunja Cloud

One of the best ways to support Vikunja is by using [Vikunja Cloud](https://vikunja.cloud). Our hosted service gives you
a hassle-free experience with automatic updates, backups, and maintenance, while directly supporting the project's development.

## Consulting and Training

* **Setup and Configuration:** We can help you deploy and configure Vikunja to fit your specific workflow and requirements.
