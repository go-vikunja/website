  Explore Vikunja's API documentation, including autogenerated Swagger docs and
  OpenAPI specifications. Access public instance or self-hosted API endpoints.
---

You can find the api docs under `/api/v1/docs` of your instance. \
A public instance is available on [https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs](https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs).

These docs are autogenerated from annotations in the code with swagger.

The specification is hosted at `/api/v1/docs.json`.
You can use this to embed it into other OpenAPI compatible applications if you want.

## Authentication

The recommended way to authenticate is with **API tokens**. Create a token under Settings > API Tokens in Vikunja's web UI and pass it in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

On self-hosted instances, you can also authenticate with username and password via the `/api/v1/login` endpoint to obtain a JWT token. Vikunja Cloud does **not** support username/password authentication — you must use API tokens.
