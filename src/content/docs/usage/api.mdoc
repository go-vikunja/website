You can find the api docs under `/api/v1/docs` of your instance. \
A public instance is available on [https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs](https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs).

These docs are autogenerated from annotations in the code with swagger.

The specification is hosted at `/api/v1/docs.json`.
You can use this to embed it into other OpenAPI compatible applications if you want.
