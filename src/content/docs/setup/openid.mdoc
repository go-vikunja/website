Vikunja allows for authentication with an external identity source such as Authentik, Keycloak or similar via the
[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/specs/) standard.

## OpenID Connect Overview

OpenID Connect is a standardized identity layer built on top of the more generic OAuth 2.0 specification, simplifying interaction between the involved parties significantly.
While the [OpenID specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Overview) is worth a read, we summarize the most important basics here.

The involved parties are:

- **Resource Owner:** typically the end-user
- **Resource Server:** the application server handling requests from the client, the Vikunja API in our case
- **Client:** the application or client accessing the RS on behalf of the RO. Vikunja web frontend or any of the apps
- **Authorization Server:** the server verifying the user identity and issuing tokens. These docs also use the words `OAuth 2.0 provider`, `Identity Provider` interchangeably.

After the user is authenticated, the provider issues a token to the user, containing various claims.
There's different types of tokens (ID token, access token, refresh token), and all of them are created as [JSON Web Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7519).
Claims in turn are assertions containing information about the token bearer, usually the user.

**Scopes** are requested by the client when redirecting the end-user to the Authorization Server for authentication, and indirectly control which claims are included in the resulting tokens.
There's certain default scopes, but it's also possible to define custom scopes, which are used by the feature assigning users to Teams automatically.

## Supported and required claims

Vikunja only requires a few claims to be present in the ID token to successfully authenticate the user.
Additional claims can be added though to customize behaviour during user creation.

The following table gives an overview about the claims supported by Vikunja. The scope column lists the scope that should request the claim according to the [OpenID Connect Standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims). It omits the claims such as `sub` or `issuer` required by the `openid` scope, which must always be present.

| Claim | Type | Scope | Comment |
| ------|------|-------|---------|
| email | required | email | Sets the email address of the user. Taken from the `userinfo` endpoint if not present in ID token. User creation fails if claim not present and userinfo lookup fails. |
| name | optional | profile | Sets the display name of the user. Taken from the `userinfo` endpoint if not present in ID token. |
| preferred_username | optional | profile | Sets the username of the user. Taken from the `userinfo` endpoint if not present in ID token. If this also doesn't contain the claim, use the `nickname` claim from `userinfo` instead. If that one is not available either, the username is auto-generated by Vikunja. |
| picture | optional | profile | If provided and not empty, sets the avatar of the user. Must be a valid url which yields an image when queried. Taken from the `userinfo` endpoint if not present in ID token. |
| vikunja_groups | optional | N/A | Can be used to automatically assign users to teams. See below for a more detailed explanation about the expected format and implementation examples. |

If one of the claims `email`, `name`, `preferred_username` or `picture` is missing from the ID token, Vikunja will attempt to query the `userinfo` endpoint to obtain the information from there. Additionally, you can set the `forceuserinfo` option to always use the `userinfo` endpoint instead of relying on claims from the ID token. This is useful for providers like Casdoor that may have inconsistencies between token data and UserInfo endpoint data.

## Configuring OIDC Authentication

To achieve authentication via an external provider, it is required to (a) configure a confidential Client on your OAuth 2.0 provider and (b) configure Vikunja to authenticate against this provider.
[Example configurations](/docs/openid-example-configurations) are provided for various different identity providers, below you can find generic guides though.

OpenID Connect defines various flow types indicating how exactly the interaction between the involved parties work, Vikunja makes use of the standard **Authorization Code Flow**.

### Step 1: Configure your Authorization Server

The first step is to configure the Authorization Server to correctly handle requests coming from Vikunja.
In general, this involves the following steps at a minimum:

- Create a confidential client and obtain the client ID and client secret
- Configure (whitelist) redirect URLs that can be used by Vikunja
- Make sure the required scopes (`openid profile email` are the default scopes used by Vikunja) are supported
- Optional: configure an additional scope for automatic team assignment, see below for details

More detailed instructions for various different identity providers can be [found here](/docs/openid-example-configurations)

### Step 2: Configure Vikunja

Vikunja has to be configured to use the identity provider. Please note that there is currently no option to configure these settings via environment variables, they have to be defined using the configuration file. The configuration schema is as follows:

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    providers:
      <provider-id>:
        name: <provider-name>
        authurl: <auth-url>  <----- Used for OIDC Discovery, usually the issuer
        clientid: <vikunja client-id>
        clientsecret: <vikunja client-secret>
        scope: openid profile email
        forceuserinfo: false # Optional: Set to true to always use UserInfo endpoint instead of ID token claims, defaults to false
```

The `<provider-id>` is used in the redirect URL for your identity provider (e.g., `/auth/openid/<provider-id>`).

The value for `authurl` can be obtained from the metadata of your provider.
Note that the `authurl` is used for [OIDC Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).
Typically, you'll want to use the `issuer` URL as found in the provider metadata.

The values for `clientid` and `clientsecret` are typically obtained when configuring the client.
The scope usually doesn't need to be specified or changed, unless you want to configure the automatic team assignment.

Optionally it is possible to disable local authentication and therefore forcing users to login via OpenID connect:

```yaml
auth:
  local:
    enabled: false
```

{% callout type="warning" %}
Migration from versions before 1.0
{% /callout %}

Version 1.0 introduced a new syntax to declare providers. If you're upgrading from a pre-1.0 version, the conversion is straightforward:

Pre-1.0 syntax (deprecated):

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    providers:
      - name: <provider-name>
        authurl: <auth-url>  <----- Used for OIDC Discovery, usually the issuer
        clientid: <vikunja client-id>
        clientsecret: <vikunja client-secret>
        scope: openid profile email
        forceuserinfo: false # Optional: Set to true to always use UserInfo endpoint instead of ID token claims, defaults to false
      - name: <provider2-name>
        authurl: <auth-url>  <----- Used for OIDC Discovery, usually the issuer
        clientid: <vikunja client-id>
        clientsecret: <vikunja client-secret>
        scope: openid profile email
        forceuserinfo: false # Optional: Set to true to always use UserInfo endpoint instead of ID token claims, defaults to false
```

1.0+ syntax:

```yaml
auth:
  openid:
    enabled: true
    providers:
      <provider-id1>:
        name: <provider1-name>
        authurl: <auth-url>  <----- Used for OIDC Discovery, usually the issuer
        clientid: <vikunja client-id>
        clientsecret: <vikunja client-secret>
        scope: openid profile email
        forceuserinfo: false # Optional: Set to true to always use UserInfo endpoint instead of ID token claims, defaults to false
      <provider-id2>:
        name: <provider2-name>
        authurl: <auth-url>  <----- Used for OIDC Discovery, usually the issuer
        clientid: <vikunja client-id>
        clientsecret: <vikunja client-secret>
        scope: openid profile email
        forceuserinfo: false # Optional: Set to true to always use UserInfo endpoint instead of ID token claims, defaults to false
```
## Login existing local user with OpenID

Vikunja allows users with existing local accounts to authenticate via SSO. This feature enables linking OpenID providers to local user accounts based on matching `email` and `username` attributes. For the fallback to work, **both** `usernamefallback` **and** `emailfallback` must be set to `true` - setting only one of them will not enable fallback matching.

Note that the fallback mapping only links OIDC logins to existing **local** user accounts. It does not merge or link users across different OIDC issuers. If you have users that were originally created through a different OIDC provider, logging in through a new provider will create a separate account even if the email address matches.

For username matching to work, the OpenID subject must match the Vikunja local account username. This requires proper configuration in your SSO provider. For example, in Authentik, edit the provider under Applications > Providers > Vikunja provider. In the advanced protocol settings, set the subject mode to `Based on the User's username`.

A configuration that enables matching on both username and email would look like this:

```yaml
auth:
  local:
    enabled: true
  openid:
    enabled: true
    providers:
      authentiklogin:
        name: "Login using authentik"
        usernamefallback: true
        emailfallback: true
        authurl: https://authentik.domain.tld/application/o/vikunja/
        clientid: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        clientsecret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

{% callout type="warning" %}
When using SSO authentication, Vikunja will create a new SSO user if no matching local user is found. If you misconfigure the matching parameters, this could result in duplicate accounts that prevent logging into the intended local account via SSO until the duplicate SSO user is deleted.

Additionally, this feature introduces potential security risks, as it allows third-party providers to authenticate as local users if they can control the username or email claims. Only enable this feature with trusted identity providers.
{% /callout %}

## Automatically login with specified provider

Vikunja supports automatic redirection to a specific OpenID provider by appending the query parameter `?redirectToProvider=provider-id1` to the login URL.

This will immediately redirect the user to the authentication flow for the provider with the key `provider-id1` in your configuration.

If you have only one provider configured, you can use any of these simplified parameters:

- `?redirectToProvider`
- `?redirectToProvider=true`
- `?redirectToProvider=1`

Example: https://vikunja.domain.tld/login?redirectToProvider=authentik

## Automatically assign users to teams

Starting with version 0.24.0, Vikunja is capable of automatically adding users to a team based on OIDC claims added by the identity provider.
If configured, Vikunja will sync teams, automatically create new ones and make sure the members are part of the configured teams.
Teams which exist only because they were created from OIDC attributes are not editable in Vikunja.

To distinguish between teams created in Vikunja and teams generated automatically via OIDC, generated teams have an `oidcID` assigned internally.
Within the UI, the teams created through OIDC get a `(OIDC)` suffix to make them distinguishable from locally created teams.

On a high level, you need to make sure that the **ID token** issued by your identity provider contains a `vikunja_groups` claim, following the structure defined below.
It depends on the provider being used as well as the preferences of the administrator how this is achieved.
Typically you'd want to request an additional scope (e.g. `vikunja_scope`) which then triggers the identity provider to add the claim.
If the `vikunja_groups` is part of the **ID token**, Vikunja will start the procedure and import teams and team memberships.

The minimal claim structure expected by Vikunja is as follows:

```json
{
    "vikunja_groups": [
        {
            "name": "team 1",
            "oidcID": 33349
        },
        {
            "name": "team 2",
            "oidcID": 35933
        }
    ]
}
```

It is also possible to pass the `description` and the `isPublic` flag as optional parameters. If not present, the description will be empty and team visibility defaults to false.

```json
{
    "vikunja_groups": [
        {
            "name": "team 3",
            "oidcID": 33349,
            "description": "My Team Description",
            "isPublic": true
        },
    ]
}
```

For each team, you need to define a team `name` and an `oidcID`, where the `oidcID` can be any string with a length of less than 250 characters.
The `oidcID` is used to uniquely identify the team, so please make sure to keep this unique.

### Custom Settings Links

The `extra_settings_links` claim allows identity providers to inject custom links into the user settings navigation in Vikunja. This is useful for organizations that want to point users to related services or documentation.

The expected format in the ID token is:

```json
{
    "extra_settings_links": {
        "key1": {"text": "Link Text", "url": "https://example.com"},
        "key2": {"text": "Another Link", "url": "https://other.com"}
    }
}
```

Each key in the object represents a unique link identifier. The `text` field is the display text shown in the navigation, and `url` is the destination when clicked.

Common use cases include:
- Linking to organization-specific documentation
- Pointing to related internal services (password reset, account management)
- Providing quick access to support resources

Below you'll find two example implementations for Authentik and Keycloak.
If you've successfully implemented this with another identity provider, please let us know and submit a PR to improve the docs.

### Setup in Authentik

To configure automatic team management through Authentik, we assume you have already [set up Authentik](/docs/openid-example-configurations#authentik) as an OIDC provider for authentication with Vikunja.

To use Authentik's group assignment feature, follow these steps:

1. Edit [your config](/docs/config-options) to include the following scopes: `openid profile email vikunja_scope`
2. Open `<your authentik url>/if/admin/#/core/property-mappings`
3. Create a new property mapping called `vikunja_scope` as scope mapping. There is a field `expression` to enter python expressions that will be delivered with the oidc token.
4. Write a small script like the following to add group information to `vikunja_scope`:

```python
groupsDict = {"vikunja_groups": []}
for group in request.user.ak_groups.all():
  groupsDict["vikunja_groups"].append({"name": group.name, "oidcID": group.num_pk})
return groupsDict
```

5. In Authentik's menu on the left, go to Applications > Providers > Select the Vikunja provider. Then click on "Edit", on the bottom open "Advanced protocol settings", select the newly created property mapping under "Scopes". Save the provider.

Now when you log into Vikunja via Authentik it will show you a list of scopes you are claiming.
You should see the description you entered on the OIDC provider's admin area.

Proceed to Vikunja and open the teams page in the sidebar menu.
You should see "(OIDC)" written next to each team you were assigned through OIDC.

### Setup in Keycloak

The kind people from Makerspace Darmstadt e.V. have written [a guide on how to create a mapper for Vikunja here](https://github.com/makerspace-darmstadt/keycloak-vikunja-mapper).

## Troubleshooting

### Vikunja ignores my configured endpoint URLs

Vikunja uses [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) to automatically determine endpoint URLs. It fetches `<authurl>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and uses the URLs returned by your provider.

This means that even if you manually configure specific endpoint URLs, the values from the discovery document will take precedence. If your provider is running on a non-standard port or behind a proxy, make sure the discovery document returns the correct URLs.

To debug, fetch the discovery document yourself:

```sh
curl https://your-provider/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
```

Verify that the `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, and `userinfo_endpoint` values point to the correct host and port.

### Usernames are auto-generated (random characters)

If users logging in via OIDC get random usernames instead of their actual name, the identity provider is not including the `preferred_username` claim. Vikunja checks these sources in order:

1. `preferred_username` from the ID token
2. `preferred_username` from the userinfo endpoint
3. `nickname` from the userinfo endpoint
4. If none are available, a random username is generated

Check your provider's configuration to ensure it includes `preferred_username` in the profile scope. Some providers (like Synology SSO) do not include this claim by default.

### Users must log in before they can be assigned to tasks

Vikunja creates user accounts on first OIDC login. There is no SCIM provisioning or bulk user import via OIDC. This means you cannot assign a user to a task or team until they have logged in at least once.

If you need to pre-create users, you can use the [Vikunja API](https://try.vikunja.io/api/v1/docs) to create local user accounts, but these will be separate from OIDC accounts unless you configure [fallback matching](#login-existing-local-user-with-openid).

### OIDC works in browser but not on mobile app

The Android and iOS apps use an embedded webview for the OIDC flow, which may behave differently than a full browser. Known limitations:

- Some providers may have issues with the webview's cookie handling
- The "Login with frontend" option is recommended for mobile OIDC
- If you see a "State does not match" error, this is typically a webview session issue

If you encounter OIDC issues only on mobile, please [report it](https://github.com/go-vikunja/app/issues) with your provider details.

## Use cases

All examples assume one team called "Team 1" to be configured within your provider.

* *Token delivers team.name +team.oidcID and Vikunja team does not exist:* \
New team will be created called "Team 1" with attribute oidcID: "33929"

2. *In Vikunja Team with name "team 1" already exists, but has no oidcID set:* \
new team will be created called "team 1" with attribute oidcID: "33929"

3. *In Vikunja Team with name "team 1" already exists, but has different oidcID set:* \
new team will be created called "team 1" with attribute oidcID: "33929"

4. *In Vikunja Team with oidcID "33929" already exists, but has different name than "team1":* \
new team will be created called "team 1" with attribute oidcID: "33929"

5. *Scope vikunja_scope is not set:* \
nothing happens

6. *oidcID is not set:* \
You'll get an error.
Custom Scope malformed
"The custom scope set by the OIDC provider is malformed. Please make sure the openid provider sets the data correctly for your scope. Check especially to have set an oidcID."

7. *In Vikunja I am in "team 3" with oidcID "", but the token does not deliver any data for "team 3":* \
You will stay in team 3 since it was not set by the oidc provider

8. *In Vikunja I am in "team 3" with oidcID "12345", but the token does not deliver any data for "team 3"*:\
You will be signed out of all teams, which have an oidcID set and are not contained in the token.
Especially if you've been the last team member, the team will be deleted.
