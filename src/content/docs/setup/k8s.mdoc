We have an official Helm Chart for Vikunja.

Check out [the repo](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/helm-chart/) for more information about how to use it.

## Third-party Helm Charts

There are two third-party Helm-Charts which can be used to host Vikunja with k8s:

* [Truecharts](https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/vikunja/)
* [k8s at Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts)
