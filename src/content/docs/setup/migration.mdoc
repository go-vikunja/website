  Learn how to migrate data from third-party services to Vikunja. Follow
  step-by-step instructions for setup, configuration, and starting the migration
  process.

There are several importers available for third-party services like Trello, Microsoft To Do or Todoist.

## Setup

To set up migration, check out [the config docs](/docs/config-options#0--migration).

## Prerequisites

Several migration sources (Trello, Todoist, Microsoft To Do) use OAuth for authentication. The OAuth redirect happens in your browser, so your Vikunja instance does **not** need to be publicly accessible from the internet — it only needs to be reachable from the browser you're using to perform the migration.

However, the `VIKUNJA_SERVICE_PUBLICURL` must be set correctly so that the OAuth redirect URL points to where your browser can reach Vikunja.

### Supported migration sources

| Source | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Todoist | OAuth |
| Trello | OAuth |
| Microsoft To Do | OAuth |
| TickTick | OAuth |
| Vikunja (file export) | File import |

If your source service is not listed, you may be able to export data as CSV or JSON and convert it to Vikunja's import format. See the [development docs](/docs/migrations) for writing custom importers.

## Start the Migration Process

Log in, and navigate to Settings > Import from other services. In the list of available third-party services, there should be an icon for each of the enabled services.
If not, ensure that the config options are properly picked up. Refer to the Vikunja log to see if the config file was loaded or not.
If there is no icon for the service you enabled, make sure your [config setup](/docs/config-options#0--migration) is correct.

Click on the service icon and on Get Started. 
This will redirect you to the service where you need to allow Vikunja Migration to access your account. 
In case there is an error when being redirected, make sure that you allowed your Vikunja domain in the allowed redirects or origin list in the service.
Once this is done, you will be redirected to Vikunja which should tell you that the migration is in progress now. 
It can take up to several hours depending on the amount of boards in your account.

## Adding new migration options

You can develop migrations for more services, see the [documentation](/docs/migrations) for more info.
