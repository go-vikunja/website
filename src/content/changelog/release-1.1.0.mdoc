  Vikunja 1.1.0 update: new features and improvements.
---

Barely two weeks after [the 1.0 release](/changelog/whats-new-in-vikunja-1.0.0/), we're back with 1.1.0!

This release contains one security fix, a bunch of bugfixes, and a few new features. Let's dive in!

## Security issue

An XSS vulnerability was discovered in a new feature that was released in 1.0.0.
We highly encourage you to upgrade to 1.1.0 which contains the fix.

We have requested a CVE via GitHub for this and will update this post with the number and details when we have it.

Thanks to [`@supercoolspy`](https://github.com/supercoolspy) for finding and reporting this!

## Fixes and improvements

- **File uploads ([#2186](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2186), [#2204](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2204)):** Fixed "permission denied" errors for S3 uploads in Docker containers, potential OOM when downloading large Unsplash backgrounds, and attachment upload errors now show user-visible notifications.
- **Logs ([#2206](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2206)):** Fixed a bug where all log categories (database, http, events, mail) were writing to the same `standard.log` file instead of their own separate log files.
- **Date parsing in quick add magic ([#2200](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2200)):** Fixed overzealous date detection that would incorrectly parse numbers in task titles as dates (e.g. "The 9/11 Report" was being parsed as a date). Numeric dates are now only recognized at the start or end of the text input or when followed by a time expression.
- **Flashing after login ([#2201](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2201)):** Fixed a visual glitch where the login form would briefly flash inside the authenticated layout for about 250ms after logging in or registering before redirecting.
- **Shared sub-projects ([#2176](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2176)):** Fixed shared sub-projects not showing in the sidebar when the parent project is inaccessible.
- **Mobile drag-and-drop ([#2198](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2198)):** Fixed drag-and-drop not working on mobile devices in list view because the browser's native long-press text selection was firing before the drag could start.

## New Features

- **S3 signing config option ([#2205](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2205)):** Added [`files.s3.disablesigning`](https://vikunja.io/docs/config-options/#2-files.s3-disablesigning) config option that sends `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` instead of computing SHA256 hashes. This fixes `XAmzContentSHA256Mismatch` errors with S3-compatible providers like Ceph RadosGW and Clever Cloud Cellar.
- **Basic Auth for webhooks ([#2137](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2137)):** Added an option to send a Basic Auth header with webhook requests. Thanks to [`@rhclayto`](https://github.com/rhclayto) for the contribution!
- **[Doctor](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli/#doctor) diagnostics ([#2179](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2179), [#2180](https://github.com/go-vikunja/vikunja/pull/2180)):** The `doctor` command now reports detailed file storage diagnostics including directory permissions, ownership, file count and size, and detects Linux user namespaces (commonly used in rootless Docker containers).

## How to Upgrade
